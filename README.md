<li>The completion of my Ph.D. and current post-doc position not only allowed me to further develop and improve my microbiology related theoretical knowledge and practical skills therein but also to stay up to date with the developments in state-of-the-art technologies.</li>

- I enjoy to be part of and actively contribute to joint projects, but I'm also self-reliant, e.g. in the design, planning and execution of experiments, and I'm not afraid to take initiative.
- I'm very good at motivating and transferring my drive and passion for science onto other people.
- Quality minded, accurate and problem-solving. In this context, I also like to engage myself in data-analysis and precision work tasks.
- I'm very flexible, and a highly motivated and curious person always willing to learn and apprehend new things in order to complete projects adequately and timely.
